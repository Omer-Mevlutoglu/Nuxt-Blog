Real Madrid celebrates its 123rd anniversary. On 6 March 1902, the first Board of Directors of the Madrid Foot Ball Club was officially elected. That marked the beginning of the legend of the greatest club in the world. 123 years later, Real Madrid is a benchmark in world sport with a record 26 European Cups (15 in football and 11 in basketball) and is honoured to have been chosen by FIFA as the Best Club of the 20th Century.

In 2024, Real Madrid claimed five more trophies to add to their legendary silverware list. As well as enhancing their supremacy in Europe by winning La Decimoquinta at Wembley and being crowned world champions for the ninth time in their history, the Whites also clinched the league, the Uefa Super Cup and the Spanish Super Cup. In basketball, Madrid are the reigning league champions, having won their 37th title in the competition.

Spectacular silverware list
Under Santiago Bernabéu’s presidency alongside legendary players such as Di Stéfano, Gento, Puskas, Kopa and Santamaría, Real Madrid conquered the first five European Cups in a row between 1956 and 1960. In 1966 came their sixth crown, with legends like Amancio and Pirri in the starting line-up. On 11 November 2023, José Martínez Pirri was named honorary president of Real Madrid at the club's Extraordinary General Assembly, succeeding the legendary Galician winger.

After the latest successes, Real Madrid’s unparalleled honours list is as follows: 15 European Cups, 9 Club World Cups, 6 Uefa Super Cups, 2 UEFA Cups, 36 LaLiga titles, 20 Copas del Rey, 13 Spanish Super Cups, 1 Copa de la Liga, 2 Latin Cups, 2 Small Club World Cups and 1 Iberoamerican Cup.

Basketball
In the basketball section, Real Madrid boast 11 European Cups, 37 League titles, 29 Copas del Rey, 10 Spanish Super Cups, 5 Intercontinental Cups, 4 European Cup Winners' Cups, 1 Korac Cup, 1 ULEB Cup and 1 Latin Cup.

Women’s football
Since 2020, the women's football team and its youth academy have also become part of the club's history. Real Madrid finished runners-up in LaLiga last season and qualified for the Women's Champions League for the fourth time in four years.

The Santiago Bernabéu stadium
The stadium is undergoing a major transformation to become a universal avant-garde landmark. The club president, Florentino Pérez, stressed its relevance at the last General Assembly: "We are in the last phase of accomplishing the great challenge that Real Madrid set itself five years ago: to make the Bernabéu an architectural emblem of Madrid. It is the most iconic stadium in world football.” In addition, Real Madrid City ranks as the best sports city in the world and continues to evolve 19 years after its inauguration.

Revenue
Real Madrid is the first football club to exceed €1 billion in revenue and the first sports organisation to have reached 600 million followers on social media. It also tops the main and most prestigious football lists, such as the Forbes and Brand Finance rankings.

Real Madrid Foundation
Real Madrid celebrates 123 years of existence as a universal club and also a club of solidarity. The Real Madrid Foundation operates in more than 100 countries and since its creation 27 years ago, it has helped to improve the lives of more than 1.5 million people through over 1,000 projects and more than 400 social schools on all continents.
