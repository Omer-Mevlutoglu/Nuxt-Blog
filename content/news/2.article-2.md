US President Donald Trump has defended sweeping tariffs on imports that sent shockwaves through global stock markets, saying "sometimes you have to take medicine to fix something".

Speaking to reporters aboard Air Force One late on Sunday, he said jobs and investment would return to the US to make it "wealthy like never before".

Trump's top officials stressed that the tariffs - announced last week - would be implemented as planned, playing down recession fears.

Just hours after Trump's comments, stock markets plunged in Asia early on Monday, with Japan's Nikkei 225 dropping by 7.8%, and Hong Kong's Hang Seng losing more than 12%.
